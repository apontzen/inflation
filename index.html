      <p>Cosmic inflation is a hypothetical period in the very early
      universe designed to solve <a
      href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_(cosmology)#Motivations"
      target="_blank">some weaknesses in the big bang theory</a>. But
      what actually happens during inflation? According to <a
      href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Inflation_(cosmology)&amp;oldid=574678934"
      target="_blank">wikipedia</a> and other respectable sources, the
      main effect is an &lsquo;extremely rapid&rsquo; expansion. That
      stock description is a bit puzzling; in fact, the more
      I&rsquo;ve tried to understand it, the more it seems like
      inflation is secretly all about <i>slow</i> expansion, not rapid
      expansion.</p>

      <p>The secret&rsquo;s not well-kept: once you know where to
      look, you can find <a
      href="http://www.roe.ac.uk/~jap/book/infmatch.pdf"
      target="_blank">a note by John Peacock</a> that supports the
      slow-expansion view, for example. But with the rapid-expansion
      picture so widely accepted and repeated, it&rsquo;s fun to
      explore why slow-expansion seems a better description. Before
      the end of this post, I&rsquo;ll try to recruit you to the cause
      by means of some crafty interactive javascript plots.</p>

      <h3>A tale of two universes</h3>

      <p id="hubble_explanation">There are many measurements which
      constrain the history of the universe. If, for example, we
      combine information about how fast the universe is expanding
      today (<a
      href="http://www.teachastronomy.com/astropedia/article/The-Hubble-Constant"
      target="_blank">from supernovae, for example</a>) with the known
      density of radiation and matter (largely from the <a
      href="http://cosmology.berkeley.edu/Education/CosmologyEssays/The_Cosmic_Microwave_Background.html"
      target="_blank">cosmic microwave background</a>), we pretty much
      pin down how the universe has expanded. An excellent cross-check
      comes from the abundance of light elements, which were
      manufactured in the first few minutes of the universe's
      existence. All-in-all, it's safe to say that we know how fast
      the universe was expanding all the way back to when it was a few
      seconds old.  What happened before that?
      </p>
      
      <p>If we assume the early universe contained particles moving
      near the speed of light (because it was so hot), we can
      extrapolate backwards. As we go back further in time, the
      extrapolation must eventually break down when energies reach the <a
      href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_scale" target="_blank">Planck
      scale</a>. But there&rsquo;s a
      huge gap between the highest energies at which physics has been
      tested in the laboratory and the Planck energy (a factor of a
      million billion or so higher). Something interesting could
      happen in between. </p>

      <p>Inflation is the idea that, because of that gap, there may
      have been a period during which the universe didn't contain
      particles. Energy would instead be stored in a scalar field (a
      similar idea to an electric or magnetic field, only without a
      sense of direction). The scale of the universe increases
      exponentially with increasing time during such a phase; the
      expansion rate accelerates. (Resist any temptation to equate
      &lsquo;exponential&rsquo; or &lsquo;accelerating&rsquo; with
      &lsquo;fast&rsquo; until you&rsquo;ve seen the graphs.)
      Ultimately the inflationary field decays back to particles and
      the classical picture resumes. By definition, all is back to
      normal long before the universe gets around to mundane things
      like manufacturing elements. </p>

      <p>For our current purposes, it&rsquo;s not important to see why
      inflation is a healthy thing for a young universe to do (<a
      href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_(cosmology)#Motivations"
      target="_blank">wikipedia lists some reasons if you&rsquo;re
      interested</a>). We just want to compare two hypothetical
      universes, both as simple as possible: </p>
      
      <ol>
	<li>a universe containing fast-moving particles (like our own once
	did);</li>
	<li>as (1), but including a period of inflation.</li>
      </ol>


      <h3>Comparisons are odorous</h3> 
      <!-- First Dickens, now Shakespeare. What else can you want? -->

      <p> There are a number of variables that might enter the comparison:</p>

      <ul> 
	<li><i>a</i>: the <i>scalefactor</i>, i.e. the relative size of a
	given patch of the universe at some specified moment;</li>

	<li><i>t</i>: the time;</li>

	<li>d<i>a</i>/d<i>t</i>: the rate at which the scalefactor
	changes with time;</li>

	<li>or if you prefer, <i>H</i>: the Hubble rate of expansion,
	which is defined as d ln <i>a</i> / d<i>t</i>.</li>
      </ul>


    <p> We'll take <i>a=1</i> and <i>t=0</i> as end conditions for the
    calculation. There's no need to specify units since we're only
    interested in comparative trends, not particular values.</p>


      <p>
	There are two minor complications. First, just what do we mean
	by &lsquo;including inflation&rsquo; in universe (2)?  To keep
	things simple it&rsquo;ll be fine just to assume that the
	pressure in the universe instantaneously changes.
	
	<span id="eos_details_invitation">(<a href="#"
	id="eos_details_switch">Click</a> for a slightly more specific
	description.) The change will kick in between two specified
	values of <i>a</i> &mdash; that is, over some range of
	&lsquo;sizes&rsquo; of the universe.</span>

	<span id="eos_details"> In particular, taking the equation of
	state of the universe to be <i>pressure = w &times; density
	&times; c<sup>2</sup></i>, we will assume <i>w=1/3</i> except
	during inflation, when <i>w= &#8211;1</i>. The value of <i>w</i>
	will switch instantaneously at <i>a=a<sub>0</sub></i>, and
	switch back at <i>a=a<sub>1</sub></i>.  </span>

	<span id="matching_details_invitation">(<a href="#"
	id="matching_details_switch">Click</a> for details of the
	transition.)</span><span id="matching_details">The density
	just carries over from the radiation to the inflationary field
	and back again (as it must, because of energy-momentum
	conservation). In reality, these transitions are messy
	(reheating at the end of inflation is an entire topic in
	itself) &#8211; but that doesn&rsquo;t change the overall
	picture.</span>
      </p>


      <h3>Finding the plot</h3>

      <p>The <a
      href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedmann_equations">Friedmann
      equations</a> (or equivalently, the <a
      href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_field_equations">Einstein
      equations</a>) take our history of the contents of the universe
      and turn it into a history of the expansion (including the
      exponential behaviour during inflation). But now a second
      complication arises: such equations can only tell you how the
      Hubble expansion rate <i>H</i> (or, equivalently,
      d<i>a</i>/d<i>t</i>) <i>changes</i> over time, not what its
      <i>actual value</i> is. So to compare universes (1) and (2), we
      need one more piece of information &#8211; the expansion rate at
      some particular moment. </p>


      <p>Since we never specified any units, we might as well take
      <i>H</i>=1 in universe (1) at <i>t</i>=0 (the end of our
      calculation).  Any other choice is only different by a constant
      scaling. What about universe (2)? As discussed above, the
      universe ends up expanding at a known rate, so really universe
      (2) had better end up expanding at the same rate as universe
      (1). But, for completeness, you&rsquo;ll be able to change that
      choice below and have universe (1) and (2) match their expansion
      rate at any time you choose.</p>
  
      <p>All that&rsquo;s left is to choose the variables to
      plot. I&rsquo;ve provided a few options in the applet below. It
      seems they all lead to the conclusion that inflation isn&rsquo;t
      ultra-rapid expansion; it&rsquo;s ultra-slow expansion.</p>
      
      <p>By the way, if you're convinced by the plots, you might
      wonder why anyone ever thought to call inflation rapid. One
      possible answer is that the expansion back then <i>was</i>
      faster than at any subsequent time.  But the comparison shows
      that this is a feature of the early universe, not a defining
      characteristic of inflation. Have a play with the plots and
      sliders below and <a href="http://www.twitter.com/apontzen"
      target="_blank">let me know</a> if there's a better way to look
      at it.
